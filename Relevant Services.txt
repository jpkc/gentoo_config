 * Pulseaudio autospawn by client library is no longer enabled when systemd is available.
 * It's recommended to start pulseaudio via its systemd user units:
 * 
 *   systemctl --user enable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket
 * 
 * Root user can change system default configuration for all users:
 * 
 *   systemctl --global enable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket

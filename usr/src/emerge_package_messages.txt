 * Messages for package dev-util/sysprof-3.48.0:

 * On many systems, especially amd64, it is typical that with a modern
 * toolchain -fomit-frame-pointer for gcc is the default, because
 * debugging is still possible thanks to gcc4/gdb location list feature.
 * However sysprof is not able to construct call trees if frame pointers
 * are not present. Therefore -fno-omit-frame-pointer CFLAGS is suggested
 * for the libraries and applications involved in the profiling. That
 * means a CPU register is used for the frame pointer instead of other
 * purposes, which means a very minimal performance loss when there is
 * register pressure.

 * Note regarding Trusted Recursive Resolver aka DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH):
 * Due to privacy concerns (encrypting DNS might be a good thing, sending all
 * DNS traffic to Cloudflare by default is not a good idea and applications

 * Upstream operates a service named Normandy which allows Mozilla to
 * push changes for default settings or even install new add-ons remotely.
 * While this can be useful to address problems like 'Armagadd-on 2.0' or
 * revert previous decisions to disable TLS 1.0/1.1, privacy and security
 * concerns prevail, which is why we have switched off the use of this
 * service by default.

 * 
 * Since firefox-91.0 we no longer install multiple shortcuts for

 * 
 * Unfortunately Firefox-100.0 breaks compatibility with some sites using

 * network.http.useragent.forceVersion preference to "99".
 * Or install an addon to change your useragent.
